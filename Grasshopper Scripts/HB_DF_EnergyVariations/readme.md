# HB_DF_EnergyVariations
## A grasshopper script to conduct energy analysis of the existing context due to the new buildings

This script is based on the Rhino model which is later translated to the Dragonfly one. New buildings are treated as the context in order to understand their impact on energy usage within the existing buildings. Schematic parameters of openings within facades are additionally added and the model is further exported to Honeybee with the implementation of  HB IdealAir system. Prepared model is then exported to OpenStudioModel and based on the .sql file results of energy consumption are received and visualised through HB Color Rooms component.
