* Select the file path of the results file in the "file path" component.
This reads the csv file and identifies the x,y,z and the value components.


Below is a sample of the csv file

|----------|--------|--------|--------|
|2         |-147.75 |-238.5  |47.461  |
|2         |-147    |-238    |47.511  |
