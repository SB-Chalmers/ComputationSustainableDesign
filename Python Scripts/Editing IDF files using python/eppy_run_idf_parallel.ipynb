    "Run IDF in Parallel\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you on how to use a Python script to run EnergyPlus simulations using IDF files in parallel. By leveraging multiple CPU cores, parallel execution can significantly decrease simulation time for large batches of IDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "-   EnergyPlus installed and added to your system's PATH.\n",
    "-   Python 3.x installed.\n",
    "-   Required Python packages: `eppy`, `bs4`, and `pandas`. Install them using `pip install eppy bs4 pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Prepare your IDF Files: Store all your IDF files that you want to simulate in a directory, named `idf` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Weather File: Ensure you have an EPW weather file available. This tutorial uses 'USA_CA_San.Francisco.Intl.AP.724940_TMY3.epw' as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  IDD File: Make sure the EnergyPlus IDD file corresponding to the IDF version you're using is available. The default in this script is \"Energy+_22_2_0.idd\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Running the Script: Run the script using Python. The function `lazy_run_IDF()` is invoked by default and initiates the parallel simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Output: Simulation results will be saved in directories under the `results` directory, with each simulation result being in a folder named `results_filename`, where `filename` is the name of the corresponding IDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Parsing Results: If you want to extract specific results, the functions available will parse the `.htm` output files and extract values such as district heating demand and total building area.\n",
    "\n",
    "FAQ:\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I change the number of CPUs used for the simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In the `lazy_run_IDF()` function, modify the `num_CPUs` parameter. Set it to the desired number of CPUs or to \"all\" to use all available CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I change the directory where my IDF files are located?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Adjust the `idf_dir` parameter in the `lazy_run_IDF()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: My simulation timestep is different. How do I modify it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Change the `simulation_timestep` parameter in the `lazy_run_IDF()` function to your desired value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I get an error related to the IDD version. What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Make sure that the version of the IDD file you're pointing to in the `iddfile` parameter matches the version of the IDF files you're trying to simulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can I extract different values from the simulation results?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Yes, you can modify the `extract_heating_value()` function or create a new function to extract different values from the `.htm` result files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: My simulation isn't writing results to the correct directory. How do I fix this?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Adjust the `results_dir` parameter in the `lazy_run_IDF()` function to your desired directory."

    "The script is designed to automate EnergyPlus simulations for multiple IDF (input data file) models in parallel. It utilizes the `eppy` library for interacting with IDF files and running EnergyPlus simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation Settings Changed**: The timestep is changed to 1, and the unit conversion for output tables is set to `JtoKWH`. These are found in the `modified_idf_run_generator` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables Fetched**: The script extracts district heating demand, total building area, and normalised district heating demand from the simulation result HTML files. The exact lines in the HTML file where this information resides is hard-coded, which is why only the first 200 lines are processed for performance reasons (as defined in the `extract_heating_value` function). If the format of the result files changes, or if additional/other information needs to be extracted, this function will need to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Import Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",

    "\n",
    "- **os, glob**: These are standard Python libraries for interacting with the system, directories, and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: Data analysis library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BeautifulSoup**: Library for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **eppy**: A Python library for scripting EnergyPlus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IDF Configuration and Running\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Create EPLaunch Options\n",
    "\n",

    "Inside the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Extract the EnergyPlus version from the IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Build a set of options which includes EnergyPlus version, output prefix (name of the IDF file without extension), output suffix, output directory, and settings to read variables and expand objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Generate List of IDF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def idf_file_generator(idf_dir):\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function orchestrates the parallel execution of EnergyPlus simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It sets the required IDD (input data dictionary) version, modifies the IDF properties (like simulation timestep), and finally runs the simulations in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. It changes the `TIMESTEP` of the IDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Modifies the output directory for each IDF file based on the `results_dir` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Finally, runs the simulations in parallel using `runIDFs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Parsing and Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Extract Heating Value\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def extract_heating_value(htm_file, num_lines=200):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function extracts district heating demand and the total building area from an EnergyPlus result HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **htm_file**: Path to the HTML file containing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **num_lines**: For performance reasons, only the first 200 lines of the HTML file are read. This value can be modified to read more or fewer lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside, it uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML tables and extract the desired values. If you need different values, you'll need to change how this function parses the HTML tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Get All HTML Files from a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_htm_files(results_dir):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function fetches all `.htm` result files from a given directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "def get_values(htm_files, verbose=False):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function goes through each HTML results file and extracts values using the `extract_heating_value` function. The extracted values are district heating demand, total building area, and normalized heating demand.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def parse_results(results_dir):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
